Description:
  Generates an initializer in config/initializers and
  runs `rake crashlog:test` to ensure you're able to send exceptions.

Example:

  rails generate crashlog KEY:SECRET

Help:
  If you receive an error during the connection test it is most likely that your
  KEY or SECRET are incorrect.

  If you continue to have issues, or you just want to say hi, send
  an email to support@crashlog.io
